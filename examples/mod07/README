Some example programs demonstrating the relationship between arrays and pointers.

arrays_n_ptrs.c is a program that shows various declarations and usage of arrays and
pointers. The comments explain the code. The output for this program looks like:

Print numbers by array indexing.
[0 : 0x7ffd4d881514] 4
[1 : 0x7ffd4d881518] 5
[2 : 0x7ffd4d88151c] 6

Print numbers using pointer syntax.
[0 : 0x7ffd4d881514] 4
[1 : 0x7ffd4d881518] 5
[2 : 0x7ffd4d88151c] 6

Sum demo_a using array index: 15
Sum demo_a using pointers: 15
Sum int_buffer using array index: 15
Sum int_buffer using ptrs: 15

Sum of products by array: 44
Sum of products by ptr: 44
Sum of products by array: 44
Sum of products by ptr: 44
Sum of products by array sum_prod_a(demo3_ptr): 44
Sum of products by ptr sum_prod_p2(demo2_a)): 44

qsort_ph_nbrs.c and qsort_ph_nbrs_ptr.c demonstrate using an array to index a
a buffer of phone numbers. Then qsort is implemented to sort the array and 
prints out the phone numbers in ascending order using the sorted array. Both
programs use the exact same program logic, but the former uses array indexes
to index the phone numbers and the latter uses pointers.
